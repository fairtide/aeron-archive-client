# aeron-archive-client

C++ implementation of Aeron Archive client.

Current version (v0.2.9) implements all commands from the Aeron Archive protocol. The C++ library interface is almost the same as the Java client library one originally created by the [Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron) team.

More details about persistent streams and Aeron Archive are available in the [real-logic/aeron wiki](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron/wiki/Aeron-Archive).

## Build

You require the following to build the C++ API for Aeron Archive Client:

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) - 3.0.2 or higher
* C++14 compiler for the supported platform
* Recent Boost library
* Java JDK to build Aeron & SBE dependencies

The project has internal dependencies on [Aeron (v. 1.15.0)](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron), [simple-binary-encoding (v. 1.11.0)](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding) & [Google Test (v. 1.8.1)](https://github.com/google/googletest) libraries which are automatically downloaded from Github by the build system

To run the full build with tests and samples:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ctest .
```

## Running samples

There are some samples provided:

* **RecordedBasicPublisher** - a simple publisher which creates a recording session with the archiving media driver
* **ReplayedBasicSubscriber** - a simple consumer of archived data
* **RecordingThroughput** - a tool to measure recording throughput
* **DriverControl** - a tool to control the archiving media driver (start/stop/delete/list recordings on a channel/stream id)

To run these samples one need to start the archiving media driver first:

```shell
$ java -cp <path-to>/aeron-all-1.15.0.jar io.aeron.archive.ArchivingMediaDriver
```

Then start **RecordedBasicPublisher** and some consumer which will subscribe to the publisher. The consumer is required for the driver to start recording. One could use a basic subscriber from Aeron samples

```shell
$ java -cp <path-to>/aeron-all-1.15.0.jar io.aeron.samples.BasicSubscriber
```

The **ReplayedBasicSubscriber** will replay the  recorded stream.

## Configuration

Fine tuning of the client can be done via a property file or via environment variables
